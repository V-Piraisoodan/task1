                HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol &
                it is used in client-server communication. 
                By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & 
                the server sends the response to the user. 
                There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will 
                focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & 
                the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

                    <h4>HTTP/1.1</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTP 1.1 is the latest version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the World Wide Web application protocol that runs on top of the Internet's TCP/IP suite of protocols. </li>
                        <li>HTTP 1.1 provides faster delivery of Web pages than the original HTTP and reduces Web traffic.</li>
                        <li>HTTP is a top-level application protocol that exchanges information between a client computer and a local or remote web server. </li>
                        <li>In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST. In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.</li>
                        <li>In addition to persistent connections and other performance improvements, HTTP 1.1 also provides the ability to have multiple domain names share the same Internet address .</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="http2">
                    <h4>HTTP2</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>HTTP/2 is the second version of HTTP with most of the shortcomings of its predecessor addressed in it. </li>
                        <li>Till the date, HTTP/2 is supported on almost all popular web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.</li>
                        <li>HTTP/2 was released at Google as the significant improvement of its predecessor. It was initially modeled after the SPDY protocol and went through significant changes to include features like multiplexing, header compression, and stream prioritization to minimize page load latency.</li>
                        <li>HTTP/2 uses HPACK compression to decrease the average size of the header. This compression program encodes the header metadata using Huffman coding, which significantly reduces its size as a result.</li>
                        <li>HTTP/2 supports full multiplexing for requests as well as responses over a single TCP connection. Due to these capabilities, lower page load times are achieved by removing needless latency and improving the overall capacity of network alongside its availability.</li>
                        <li>The HTTP/2â€™s ability to transmit more data per client-server communication cycle greatly improves web performance. As a result, increased user satisfaction, better SEO, greater productivity, growing userbase, and improved sales figures can be achieved.</li>
